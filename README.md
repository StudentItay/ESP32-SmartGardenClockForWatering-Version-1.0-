# ESP32-SmarTemp-No1

## ðŸ“Œ About the Project
This project is designed to develop a smart system for monitoring temperature and humidity, and in the future, also controlling fertilization and pH levels for automatic irrigation using an ESP32.  
ðŸ“Œ Currently, the project is in the simulation stage, but in the future, I plan to build a physical device with sensors to measure real temperature and humidity data.

## ðŸš€ Project Status
ðŸ“Œ Currently in development.  
ðŸ“Œ Recently improved the `sketch.ino` file.  
ðŸ“Œ The next step is to perform further tests, enhance the interface, and release an initial version of an application to support data analysis.  
ðŸ“Œ A future version will include a physical device with sensors for real-time measurements.

## ðŸ›  Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language**: C++ (Arduino)
- **Hardware**: ESP32
- **IDE**: Arduino IDE / VS Code with PlatformIO

## ðŸ“‚ How to Use the Code?
1. Download and install Arduino IDE.
2. Make sure you have installed the necessary libraries (WiFi, MQTT, etc.).
3. Connect the ESP32 to your computer, upload the code, and monitor the data via the Serial Monitor.
